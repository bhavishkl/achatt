## Architecture Decisions

- **State Management**: Zustand with `persist` middleware (localStorage) for client-side data persistence
- **No Database**: All data stored in browser localStorage via Zustand persist
- **Report Calculation**: Pure function `computeAttendanceReport()` computes working days and salary based on group assignments
- **Salary Formula**: `netSalary = (basicSalary / daysInMonth) * workingDays` where `workingDays = totalDays - weekOffs - holidays - leaves`

## Tab Interface

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| 👥 Employees | CRUD for employee profiles (ID, name, salary, department) |
| 📅 Week Off | Create week-off groups, select days, assign employees |
| 🎉 Holidays | Create holiday groups with specific dates, assign employees |
| 🏖️ Leaves | Create leave groups with monthly allowance, assign employees |
| ⏰ Shifts | Create shift groups with start/end times, assign employees |
| 📊 Report | Auto-generated monthly attendance & salary report |

## Dependencies Added

- `zustand` v5.0.11 - State management with persistence
